services:

  jenkins:
    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11
    ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:9080:8080"
    volumes:
    - ./jenkins_home_on_host:/var/jenkins_home
    # using a bind mount to the host `./jenkins_home` means I can easily peruse the jenkins_home files without needing to "get into the container"
    restart: unless-stopped
    # a named volume is fine too - jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home



  # I like docker-compose because I can easily spin up multiple apps like a test email server alongside jenkins! for testing email notifications from jenkins (later)
  mails:
    image: mailhog/mailhog
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:8025:8025" # mailhog's web app (think test instance of gmail)
    # "127.0.0.1:1025:1025" # jenkins will use `mail:1025` to send emails, only map to host if you want to send files


## NOTES:
# Host port bindings are constrained to listening on 127.0.0.1
# - avoids external access to services
# - To open external access:
#   - Remove IP address constraint to open the flood gates
#   - Bind to another IP
